I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh. Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Data Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Broadly, my interests lie in high dimensional statistics, statistics education, and statistics philosophy.

Currently, my research is focused on studying the fragmentation patterns amongst cell-free DNA found in plasma. If we can infer cell type of origin based soley on where each piece of DNA was fragmented, then it would not only provide new ways to develop non-invasive testing for health conditions like fetal aneuploidy, preeclampsia, and endometriosis, but also further our understanding of this new type of -omics data.
