I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in statistics looking to pursue a PhD in the same field. I am a current undergraduate researcher studying the statistical methods that can be used to compare functional connectivity networks. Previously, I did work analyzing the performance of various network clustering algorithms on synthetic and real-world data. I have over 2 years of experience in tutoring mathematics and am proficient in Python, R, and MATLAB. My research interests are in regards to statistical inference on network data. Specifically, I am curious about the clustering, hypothesis testing, and random models that can be applied to network data.
