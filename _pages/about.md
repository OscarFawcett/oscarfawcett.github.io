I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh. Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Data Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Broadly, my interests lie in high dimensional statistics, statistics education, and statistics philosophy.

Currently, I am researching cell free DNA fragment data under the supervision of Dr. Chris McKennan. When a cell dies, enzymes cleave their DNA into small fragments that then float in plasma. The goals of this project are twofold: first, how do we represent the cfDNA fragments in a data matrix? And second, can we infer cell type of origin from these cfDNA fragments? The second question has potential applications for non-invasive disease diagnosis.
