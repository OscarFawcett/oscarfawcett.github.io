I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in statistics and analytics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I am studying the statistical methods that can be used to compare functional connectivity networks. Previously, I did work analyzing the performance of various network clustering algorithms on synthetic and real-world data. I have over 2 years of experience in tutoring mathematics and am proficient in Python, R, and MATLAB. My research interests are in regards to high dimensional statistics, particularly on datasets with a network representation. I am also broadly interested in statistics education and statistics philosophy.
