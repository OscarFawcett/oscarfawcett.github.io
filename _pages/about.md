I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in statistics looking to pursue a PhD in the same field. I am a current undergraduate researcher studying the statistical methods being applied to network connectomics. Previously, I did work analyzing the performance of various network clustering algorithms on synthetic and real-world data. I have over 2 years of experience of tutoring in mathematics and am proficient in Python, R, and MATLAB. My research interests are in regards to random networks. Specifically, I am curious about random network models that can be applied to observable data and the inferential statistics that can be performed on such models.
