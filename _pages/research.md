Consulting
=====

At the University of Pittsburgh, I have had many opportunities to consult with practicing scientists across many disciplines including material science, otolaryngology, biological science, and more. Iâ€™m always looking to learn more about active areas of research and new ways to further my scientific impact, so if you would like to meet to discuss a possible collaboration, please email me at osf8@pitt.edu.
